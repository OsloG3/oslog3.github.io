		The city stirred before dawn, trolley bells cutting the quiet as
		merchants opened their shutters and morning papers slipped onto stoops.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		After some agressive bidding from the opponents we end up in 3!sX that doesn't look favourite to make. <br>
		The lead is the __ of diamonds, which we duck to East's Jack and a spade switch. We have 22 HP between our hands, and opponents with only 18 points between them managed to find an opening and an invite. Their points must be splitting 9-9 or 8-10 and they must have good suit quality and distribution to justify all the bidding with so few points. At matchpoints the double of 3!s could be from just three spades, but considering they lack any power in high cards and their  implied distribution spades must be 4-1. Diamonds seem to be 1-6 as a 2-5 would not justify the agressive bidding. Clubs could be 6-2 or 7-1 implying respectivly 2-4 or 1-5 hearts. It seems like clubs must be 6-2 and hearts 2-4, because with clubs 7-1 East would probably have showed his 6-5(he might also have choseen to open 1!h with a weak 1=5=6=1) and he might also have returned a club to attempt to getting a ruff with his singleton trump. The distributions must be 4=2=1=6 and 1=4=6=2 we already know the honor distribution in spades and diamonds, and we can assume good suit quality to give West KJ93 xx 7 KJxxxx and East 5 Q10xx AQJxxx x . We want to get back to our hand to pull more trumps it's not clear that taking the heart finess will result an extra trick as we don't have the entries to cash the third heart, but we are conftable in our read off the cards and play a heart to the J. When that works we play a spade that West wins with the Ace and returns a clubs that we run to our 10, that was a fortunate(for us) slip up from the defense, but resonable considering that from West perspective his partner can have at most 9 points outside of clubs so it's resonable to expect him to have a club honor for his opening bid. At this point we could try King of hearts spade to dummy and Ace of hearts, but we know this would get ruffed, but at this point we have a guaranteed way of making our contract(assuming we read the hand correctly) we play a spades to dummy club back to hand and pull the last trump pitching a heart. We then play the last spade pitching an other heart from dummy. This leaves dummy with !hA9 !dKx and in hand !hk !d109 !c10 and East has to choose 4 red suit cards to keep. If he chooses to keep three diamonds and one heart we can play our heart overtaking with the A and cash the now good 9 of hearts, if he chooses to keep 3 hearts and stiff Ace of diamonds we can just duck a diamond too the A and collect the next 3 tricks. If he chooses to keep 2 cards in both red suits we have two options 1) play heart to the Ace and and an other heart end-playing East into giving us the K of diamonds 2) cash the King of hearts and give up a diamond, East will cash his second diamond but will have to concede the last trick to dummies Ace of hearts. The reader is left to judge which option is more pleasing and should be chosen at the table<br>

          Everyone follows small at trick one and East switches to hearts.<br>
          We win in dummy to preserve an entry to our clubs and take a club finesse that wins and we contrinue with Ace and an other clubs with clubs splitting 3-3 with West winning the third club and switching to the Q of hearts that we win, East pitching a spade, and start cashing our clubs. We pitch in order to leave dummy ith !sJ10 !dAQ and in our hand we are left with !s95 !h6 !d2 as this will exrt maximum pressure on West. East pitchese one more spade and two diamonds while West pitches one heart and 2 diamonds(the 8 and Jack). We know West has 3 hearts left and one other card. This fourth card could be one of three options: The !sQ, a small diamond or the !dK. in the first two cases we want to take the diamonds finesse, in the third case we want to cash the Ace of diamonds dropping the stiff King. In the first option West would have started with !sQx !hQJ9xxx !dJx !cK109, in the second case !sx !hQJ9xxx !dJ8x !cK109 in the third case !sx !hQJ9xxx !dKJx !cK109 option one would not be a 2!h opener vulnerable for most players
