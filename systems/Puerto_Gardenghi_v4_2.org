* Carding

Standard count and reverse attitude. K lead asks for count(or unblock vs NT), the Q could be from a weak KQx(x) holding \\

vs Suit:\\

3/low leads, suit preference in the trump suit\\

vs NT:\\

2/4: low from small dubleton( 9x we lead x, 10x we lead the 10), the 9 promises exatcly 1 higher card( that could be the 10)\\

3/5: if partner showed 4+cards in the suit\\

reverse smith (low I like the lead suit) only at trick 2 after declarer won the opening lead. Smith is off ONLY if declarer plays a suit where we might need to cutoff dummy( dummy has no side entry or only 1 and the suit requires 2 to setup). In all other cases Smith is on. If the lead suit has a clear layout giving encoureging smith shows that we don’t like the switch to new suit.\\

* Slam bidding

*** Key card asking

RKCB with suit X set:

- step-1: 1 or 4 KC
- step-2: 0 or 3 KC
- step-3: 2 + no Q of trumps
- step-4: 2 + Q of trumps
- step-5: even KC + a void
- step-6+: odd KC + a void in bid suit/ in a suit above if bidding the trump suit

After step 1 and 2 the first next available step that isn’t 5X asks for the Q of trumps.

If the Q ask is below 5X then: 5X = no Q; 6X = Q + new kings to bid, bid in between Q + the king in the suit bid.

If the Q ask is above 5X it promises all KC then: 

- 6X = no Q;
- 5NT = Q no King
- new suit = Q + King in the suit bid
- the cheapest bid is ambiguos a) the meaning given by the rules above b) Q + a king that cant be bid below 6X and no other Kings.

After steps 1 to 4 the first available step that isn’ the trump suit, or the Q ask, is a specific king ask and promises all KC.

We bid the the cheapest suit we have a King and if available can use 5NT to show a king above 6X.

After a positive response to the King or Q ask bidding a suit where partner could  still have a king ask for that specific king.

Bidding a suit where partner cannot have a King asks for 3rd round control in that suit.

Bidding 5NT, either directly after RKCB(if it is not a Q or K ask) or after a positive Q or K ask response asks for specific Queens: we bid the first Q we have available to bid.

If we have denied a King in suit(either we skipped the cubdbid, or partner cuebid the suit and is known to not have shortness in said suit and we have the A in that suit) we treat the Q in that suit as a King in response to the Q or K ask (but still a Q if partner makes a 5NT specific Q ask)



*** Exclusion

- step-1 0
- step-2 1 but no Q
- step-3 1 + Q
- step-4 2 but no Q
- step-5 2 + Q

If they DBL/overcall after our RKCB/exclusion we play DEPO/REPO (DBL/ReDBL odd KC, Pass even KC)

*** 6KC blackwood

- 5!c 1-4
- 5!d 0-3
- 5!h 2-5 + 0 Qs
- 5!s 2-5 + 1 Qs
- 5NT 2-5 + 2 Qs
- 6!c even KCs + a void
- 6x odd KCs + a void

over 5!c/5!d first available step queen ask 0/1/ 2+Ks, second step K ask.



*** Setting suits at the 4 level

If we showed a major two suiter ending at 4!c with 8+ card fit possible in both suits (2!c-2!d-4!c or after some relay)

- 4!d sets !h
- 4M to play
- 4NT RKCB in !s





*** 2/1 Auctions 

In 2/1 GF auctions(including the 2-way 1M-[2M-2]) we use 2NT as just waiting while bidding a suit at the 3 level is distributional(5/5 when possible, 6/4 when 5/5 is not possible) if our first suit was a minor and we rebid 3m it shows a hand that is happy to be supported to 4m(either a very distributional hand or enough for slam)

The GF transfer show 5+cards in the above suit except after (2m)-DBL-(pass)-? where 2m was a weak two or a natural precision opening. In that case the transfer only promise 4 or more cards in the suit.

Accepting the GF transfer ==denies== a fit and ==denies== a stop.



*** High level competitive agreements

- 1

If we showed invitational+ values and opponents compete above our game(4 level if it’s unclear which one is our game) we are in forcing pass.

- 2

If we opened a preempt and partner raised, our DBL is interest in competing. Rare but also applies if partner didn’t raise and we would be on lead.

- 3

After we found a fit, but we have not had a chance to describe our hand and opponents bid above our game DBL is interest in competing.

1x — (1/2Y) — DBL — (4/5Y)

and similar auctions DBL could be from a strong hand, but it could also be from a more distributional hand interested in competing.



*** Random competitive sequences with special meanings

( 4!s ) — DBL — ( pass ) — ? and comparable auctions:

- 4NT two placees to play or to play 5!h
- 5!h slam invitational





**1x — ( 2Y ) — pass — ( pass )**

DBL - ( pass ) - ?

Lebensohl donde positivo es interes a manga frente 17-18



- 2/1 competition

On 2/1 auctions if the overcall at the two or four+ level DBL is penalties. If they overcall at the 3 level DBL(only by opener) is shortness(0-1) in the suit ovecalled.



- If they open a weak two in a Major
  - 2NT 15-18 con parada –> transfer y transfer al palo de ellos es styamn normal
  - 3M cueibid, pide parada, puede ser mano muy fuerte con menor largo que no quiere doblar
  - 4M menores fuerte– 4ST 6KC?
  - 4NT menores no tan fuerte



- Abrimos de barrage y nos doblan
  - ReDBL pide partner que castige si tiene 3+ cartas en el palo donde van a correr



- 1X - (3Y) - DBL - (4Y) si su palo es major que el nuestro (Y > X) estamon en FP
- 1ST - (2ST+) - DBL - (4X) estamos en FP
