Opening choice in the 11-15 range:

With 11-13 balanced open your longer suit: with 4/4 the higher ranking but open 1:hearts: with 4=4 majors, and 1:diamonds: with 4:clubs:333. With a single-suiter open your longest suit, 6M4m is often treated as a single-suiter. 

With a two-suiter w/o clubs open the shorter(lower ranking with 5/5) and rebid the longer. 

With M+:clubs: open the major regardless of length. With both minors open the longer(1:diamonds: with 5/5).

### After 1M-2x 2/1

- 2X+1:	clubs ambiguous length
- 2S 	11-13 balanced
- 2N 	natural 2S bid
- 3C 	natural 2X+1 bid
- Other: natural canape/single suiter

Exception: 1S-2H now 2S is clubs, 2N is bal and 3C is 6+S

Over 2X+1 or 2S we can bid naturally or bid 2N to ask partner to show his shape. 

### Competitive bidding over after our 1M opening

After an overcall of our 1D/M opening: DBL from responder asks opener to show a canape if he has one.

After 1M-(2m)-X-(pass) or 1S-(2H)-X-(pass)

Opener bids 2M with balanced 11-13 4/5M, while 2NT by opener shows 5M-4C(3C would promise a canape) (R.G when 2NT isn't needed to show balanced hand it shows 5M 4+C).  Therefore doubler should either have 3 card support and pass 2M, or a strong enough hand to bid over 2M.
