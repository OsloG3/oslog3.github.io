## Carding

UDCA

vs NT :: 2/4 leads(2nd from any 3 or from 4+ weak suit), attitude on A/Q lead from partner, count on other leads (K ask for unblock as well).

Reverse smith at trick 2(never delayed smith) from both players, unless count is needed to stop a long suit in dummy with no entries. When the position of the lead suit is clear, negative smith implies interest in the obvious switch.

vs Suit :: 3/5 leads, K ask for count, attitude on other leads

Standard suit preference in the trump suit and when it makes sense

## Competitive agreements

After 1 or 2 level overcall new suits at the 1 or  3 level are forcing, new suits at the 2 level are NF, and jump are fit showing.

Jumps in new suits are fit jumps (unless agreed otherwise for that spot)

Jumps to 4M by an unpassed hand are always natural

Unusual over unusual after overcalls showing 2 known suits (lower cuebid shows support when partner has already shown a suit)

==When UoU is on DBL sets penalty dbl or second DBL still TO?==

Micheals cuebids (1m)-2:diamonds: :: Major; (1m)-3m :: :spades:+om



(1x) - DBL - (pass) - 2x(cue-bid) is forcing to 2NT or suit repetition

(1x) - DBL - (1M) - DBL=4+M constructive+



**Grue switch**

When opponents show :spades: and partner bids a natural 3:hearts: and no other suits have been bid. Like: (2:spades:) - 3:hearts: - (pass) - ? now 3:spades: is a stopper ask or a strong natural 4:clubs: bid, while 4:clubs: shows a :hearts: raise with stronger than 4:hearts:

**Other switch:**

When we have shown a major and opponents compete at the 3 level or partner has just competed to 3M and we don't have a 3level cuebid we use 4:clubs: as the strong raise, and the cuebid as the natural 4:clubs: bid

Examples: 

1M-(3:diamonds:/3oM)- ? 4:clubs:=stronger raise; 4cue = strong :clubs:.

 (3:diamonds:)-3M-(pass)-? . 

(2:spades:) - 3:hearts:  - (pass) - ?

(1:hearts:) - 1:spades: - (3:hearts:) - ?

 

|  (1R)  |                     DBL                     | (3R) | 3:spades: |
| :----: | :-----------------------------------------: | :--: | :-------: |
| (pass) | 4:clubs: :spades: ISL; 4R=:clubs: power DBL |  -   |     -     |



**1M - (DBL) - 2M **

- DBL no 4oM (can be 5:hearts: inv)
  - (pass)
    - 2:spades:(over 2:hearts) min, probably 4:spades: 333
    - 2NT, generic minimum
    - 3m natural some extras
    - 3oM reverse with 5+oM
- 2NT ask for better minor, can be 4oM inv+
- 3m to play
- 3M(cuebid) 5oM GF
- 3:hearts:(over 2:spades:) to play
- 3:spades:(over 2:hearts:) 5:spades: invitational



==**General rules guidelines of what DBL is**==



==**General rules for when Forcing pass is on**==

### Rubensohl after 2 level overcalls of 1:clubs:, 1NT and 2:clubs:

After a 2 level over call  of any of the above openings (unless it shows two know suits then we play UoU) we play:

(1X)

- DBL:     TO, (generic streangth vs no achor suit overcalls)
- 2Y:        natural NF
- 2NT:     lowest unbid suit
- 3:clubs: :    middle unbid suit
- 3:diamonds::     highest unbid suit (:hearts: when no anchor suit)
- 3:hearts::    GF TO with short X and 3 or 4 in unbid majors(5+:spades: when no anchor suit)
- 3:spades::    xfer to 3NT after 1/2:clubs:; minors or majors the one that makes sense after 1NT



Transfer to a suit below the overcall is constructive or better, opener can supper accept or just accept the xfer with any normal hand.

Transfer to a suit above the overcall is invitational or better, opener can accept the transfer with a minimum with support, bid 3NT/4M with a max or bid the step with no better bid (usually: no Fit min, or max no supp + no stop)



### Defence to 1NT

- DBL: strength ==(how strong direct X vs weak/mini NT?)==

- 2:clubs: landy
  - (DBL) — same after multi: pass to play, XX I have my suit, other system on
  
- 2:diamonds: 6+M ==How do we respond to 2NT ask?==
- 2M 5M (4)5+m
- 2NT minors



### Defence vs preempts:

**Vs weak two openings: **

3 level cue bid asks for stoper

leaping micheals

Lebensohl, Fast denies.



**Vs multi** 

DBL 13-15 balanced or strong— later X still TO and delayed lebensohl (could also do Rubensohl as DBL is available)



**Vs level preempts** 

==Do we play non-leaping==?

==If we overcall 3NT then 4:clubs: stayman, 4:diamonds:/:hearts:/:spades: game ordered transfer?​==
