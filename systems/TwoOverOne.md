# Opinionated Two over one



WORK IN PROGRESS

[TOC]



## Openings

- 1:clubs: 11+ 4+:clubs: unbal or 12-14 balanced (14-16 when 1NT is 10-13)
- 1:diamonds: 11+ 4+:diamonds: unbalanced 
- 1:hearts: 5+:hearts: 11+
- 1:spades: 5+:spades: 11+
- 1NT (14)15-17
- 2:clubs: 18-19 balanced or GF w/o primary clubs
- 2:diamonds: 5+:diamonds: weak
- 2M 5+M weak
- 2NT 20-22 balanced
- 3x preemptive
- 3NT Good 4M preempt
- 4/5x nat preempt



Opening choice: Unbalanced hands with primary clubs are opened 1:clubs: even if with GF values. With (14)44 1:clubs: if 12-14, open 1NT or 1:diamonds: with 15+.

1NT can be done on creative shapes, including 5m4M22 or 6m332, but also some 5M4m22 and even 5M4m31 with stiff honors.



## Carding

UDCA

Leads: 2/4 (low from two small, always second from 3).

Primary signal on partner's lead is count except on A lead, or on a K lead when a bath coup is possible.

Reverse smith at trick 2(never delayed smith) from both players, unless count is needed to stop a long suit in dummy with no entries. When the position of the lead suit is clear, negative smith implies interest in the obvious switch.

Standard suit preference in the trump suit and when it makes sense

### Competitive auctions after 1NT or 2:clubs: opening

After a 2X overcall, either natural, or that doesn't promise any suit

- DBL :: TO
- 2Y :: S.O
- 2NT :: :clubs: or s.o. in some other suit
- 3Y :: inv+ transfer
- 3(X-1) xfer to their suit :: TO DBL with shortness in their suit
  - 3X :: ask for 4 card overcallsmajor
- 3:spades: ???



After a 3:clubs: overcall

- X :: TO

- 3:diamonds:/:hearts: :: transfer to M inv+
- 3:spades: :: xfer to :diamonds:?



Unusual over unusual after two know suit overcalls. Does DBL set pen X or next DBL still TO?

After DBL of an art overcall next DBL is TO





## 2:diamonds: Opening



## 2:hearts: Opening



## 2:spades: Opening



## 2NT Opening



## 3:clubs: Opening

- 3:diamonds:: puppet to 3:hearts:
  - 3:hearts: forced
    - pass: long :hearts: weak
    - 3:spades: long spades weak
    - 3NT game try, pass with 2 of top 3 (1 of top 3 when opening NV vs VUL)

- 3M natural GF
- 3NT to play
- 



## 3NT Opening

- 4:clubs: xfer to your Major --> 4NT RKCB
- 4:diamonds: generic ISL
  - 4M min
  - 4NT cue other M
  - 5m cue --> 5/6:hearts: p/c
- 4:hearts: pass or correct
- 4:spades: To play(I know you have :spades:)



## Competitive agreements

After 1 or 2 level overcalls new suits at the 1 or  3 level are forcing, new suits at the 2 level are NF

Jumps in new suits are fit jumps (unless agreed otherwise for that spot)

Jumps to 4M by an unpassed hand are always natural

Unusual over unusual after overcalls showing 2 known suits (lower cuebid shows support when partner has already shown a suit)

Micheals cuebids (1m)-2:diamonds: :: Major; (1m)-3m :: :spades:+om

(1x)-DBL-(pass)-2x(cue-bid) is forcing to 2NT or suit repetition



**Grue switch**

When opponents show :spades: and partner bids a natural 3:hearts: and no other suits have been bid. Like: (2:spades:) - 3:hearts: - (pass) - ? now 3:spades: is a stopper ask or a strong natural 4:clubs: bid, while 4:clubs: shows a :hearts: raise with stronger than 4:hearts:

**Other switch:**

When we have shown a major and opponents compete at the 3 level or partner has just competed to 3M and we don't have a 3level cuebid we use 4:clubs: as the strong raise, and the cuebid as the natural 4:clubs: bid

Examples: 

1M-(3:diamonds:/3oM)- ? 4:clubs:=stronger raise; 4cue = strong :clubs:.
