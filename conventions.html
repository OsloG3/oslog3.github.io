		<h3>Canape Strong club</h3>
			The system file is not finished yet, and some sequences are still missing or have errors. <br>
			This a strong 1</span>♣️<span> system with 4 card majors and canape <br>
			The system is largelly inspired by Jan-Erik Larrson's Cottonail and David Kok's adapation Kok's canape. <br>
			The system uses 4 card majors, opening balanced 11-13 hands with a 4 card Major 1M, this are high frequency and provide a partial preempt similar to a mini NT, and often allow partner to raise the level with fit(that mini NT's can not) and with the opening being limited partner can often raise to 3/4M without worry of preempting partner.<br>
			Canape is then a natural choice to avoid missing 5-3 fits that can be problematic in non canape 4 card majors. It sacrifices finding quickly (and some times completly) the 5-3 fits but in return keeps oponents in the dark on the nature of our hand and prevents them from making TO double of our true longest suit.<br>
			This particular adaptation of Cottonail club is meant to be as simple as possible to allow players to quickly try the system(even if simple to remember it might take time to get used to the canape style of bidding) and keeps (almost) all that can be played as natural as natural. It is by no means perfect, but it still packs the punch required to have fun and get good results<br>
